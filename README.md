## 🌐 Offline-First Philosophy

ISPLedger is designed with **offline-first** as a core principle. Many ISP operators work in areas with unreliable internet, or simply prefer to keep their business data local and private.

With ISPLedger:
- You don't need an internet connection to access your clients or billing records
- No data is sent to external servers unless you explicitly choose to back up to Google Drive
- You're in full control of your information at all times

If the internet goes down, **your business operations don't**. That's the ISPLedger promise.
